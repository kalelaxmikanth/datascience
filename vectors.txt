vectors

first we need to include header file

#include<vector>

vector<datatype>vector_name;

if we wanna include size in vector 

vector<datatype>vector_name(size);

if we want t create int datatype vector with size

vector<int>v(5);

if we wanna find the size of vector then 

v.size()

if we wanna resize the vector

v.resize(new size number);

capacity:

capacity is mean by capacity is >= size. but it is not the size.

ex: if the vector size is 8. than its capacity of storing elements or numbers is 16 or 20 its depend on compiler.

if vector<int>v(5); size is 5 maximum of storing elements is 10 or 11 or 12 depends on computer compiler.

in vector we can easily add elements. we dont need to bother about the size.

if we add elements in vector

v.pushback(element)

ex: 1 2 3 4 

v.pushback(5)

1 2 3 4 5

if we insert an element in the middle of the  vector

v.insert(position,element)

to find the position of number

v.begin() is at what position the vector is starting

v.end() is at what position the vector is ending

ex: a vector

2 3 4 6

we need to insert a number 5 at second position of that vector 

v.insert(v.begin()+2,5)

i.e 2 5 3 5 6 
v.insert(v.end()-2,5)

i.e 2 3 5 4 6
